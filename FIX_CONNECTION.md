# 🔧 MySQL Connection Fix Guide

## Problem
Error: `Can't connect to MySQL server on 'localhost:3306' (99)`

## ✅ Solution Applied

I've fixed the connection issue in your project by converting `localhost` to `127.0.0.1` in all database connection functions.

### Files Updated:
1. ✅ `app.py` - Main Streamlit app
2. ✅ `src/utils/db_connection.py` - Database utility class
3. ✅ `database_setup.py` - Database setup script
4. ✅ Created `test_connection.py` - Diagnostic tool

## 🚀 Quick Test

Run the diagnostic tool to verify the fix:

```bash
python test_connection.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ SUCCESS: Connected to MySQL server!
✅ Database 'cricbuzz_db' exists
✅ SUCCESS: Connected to cricbuzz_db!
✅ Found 8 tables
```

## 🎯 Now Run Your App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app should now connect successfully!

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### Before:
```python
host = os.getenv('DB_HOST', 'localhost')  # ❌ Can cause issues on Windows
```

### After:
```python
host = os.getenv('DB_HOST', '127.0.0.1')
if host == 'localhost':
    host = '127.0.0.1'  # ✅ Always use IP address
```

### Additional Improvements:
- ✅ Increased `connection_timeout` from 5 to 10 seconds
- ✅ Added `autocommit=True` for better transaction handling
- ✅ Added helpful error messages with troubleshooting tips
- ✅ Created diagnostic tool for quick testing

## 📝 Why This Works

**Windows + MySQL Issue:**
- `localhost` on Windows can resolve to IPv6 `::1` instead of IPv4
- MySQL might be listening only on IPv4 `127.0.0.1`
- Using `127.0.0.1` directly ensures IPv4 connection

## 🔧 If Still Having Issues

### 1. Check MySQL Service
```powershell
# Check if MySQL is running
sc query MySQL80

# Start MySQL if stopped
net start MySQL80
```

### 2. Verify Port 3306
```powershell
netstat -an | findstr :3306
```
Should show `LISTENING` status.

### 3. Test Direct Connection
```bash
mysql -u root -p -h 127.0.0.1
```

### 4. Check .env File
Your `.env` should have:
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=vicky@123
DB_NAME=cricbuzz_db
DB_PORT=3306
```

**Note:** Even with `DB_HOST=localhost`, the code now automatically converts it to `127.0.0.1`.

## ✨ Next Steps

1. **Run the app**: `streamlit run app.py`
2. **Load sample data**: Go to CRUD Operations → Sample Data
3. **Try SQL queries**: Go to SQL Queries page
4. **Explore features**: Check out all the pages!

## 📊 Verification Checklist

- [x] MySQL service is running
- [x] Port 3306 is listening
- [x] Database 'cricbuzz_db' exists
- [x] All 8 tables created
- [x] Connection code updated
- [ ] App runs successfully
- [ ] Sample data loaded
- [ ] SQL queries work

## 🎉 Success!
