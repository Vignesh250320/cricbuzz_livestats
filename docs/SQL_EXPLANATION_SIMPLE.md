## What is SQL?

**SQL** = Structured Query Language

**What it does**: Ask questions to a database

**Think of it like**: Asking a librarian for books
- You: "Show me all books by this author" (SQL query)
- Librarian: Searches and brings books (Database returns results)

**Why SQL for Data Science?**
- Analyze large amounts of data
- Find patterns and insights
- Calculate statistics
- Join related data together

---

## Basic SQL Commands

### 1. SELECT (Show me)
**What**: Get data from a table

```sql
-- Get all columns
SELECT * FROM players;

-- Get specific columns
SELECT player_name, country FROM players;

-- Get with calculation
SELECT player_name, runs * 2 AS double_runs FROM players;
```

**Real-life**: "Show me all players" or "Show me just names and countries"

---

### 2. WHERE (Filter/Only if)
**What**: Filter results based on conditions

```sql
-- Single condition
SELECT * FROM players WHERE country = 'India';

-- Multiple conditions (AND)
SELECT * FROM players WHERE country = 'India' AND playing_role = 'Batsman';

-- Multiple conditions (OR)
SELECT * FROM players WHERE country = 'India' OR country = 'Australia';

-- Comparison operators
SELECT * FROM players WHERE age > 30;
SELECT * FROM players WHERE age >= 25;
SELECT * FROM players WHERE age < 35;
```

**Real-life**: "Show me players, but only from India"

---

### 3. ORDER BY (Sort)
**What**: Sort results

```sql
-- Ascending (smallest to largest)
SELECT * FROM players ORDER BY age ASC;

-- Descending (largest to smallest)
SELECT * FROM players ORDER BY runs DESC;

-- Multiple columns
SELECT * FROM players ORDER BY country, age DESC;
```

**Real-life**: "Sort players by age, youngest first"

---

### 4. COUNT (How many)
**What**: Count rows

```sql
-- Count all rows
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players;

-- Count with condition
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players WHERE country = 'India';

-- Count distinct values
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country) FROM players;
```

**Real-life**: "How many players are there?"

---

### 5. SUM (Add up)
**What**: Add numbers together

```sql
-- Total runs
SELECT SUM(runs_scored) FROM batting_stats;

-- Total runs by player
SELECT player_id, SUM(runs_scored) FROM batting_stats GROUP BY player_id;
```

**Real-life**: "What's the total runs scored?"

---

### 6. AVG (Average)
**What**: Calculate average

```sql
-- Average runs
SELECT AVG(runs_scored) FROM batting_stats;

-- Average by player
SELECT player_id, AVG(runs_scored) FROM batting_stats GROUP BY player_id;
```

**Real-life**: "What's the average score?"

---

### 7. MAX and MIN (Highest and Lowest)
**What**: Find maximum or minimum value

```sql
-- Highest score
SELECT MAX(runs_scored) FROM batting_stats;

-- Lowest score
SELECT MIN(runs_scored) FROM batting_stats;

-- Both together
SELECT MAX(runs_scored) AS highest, MIN(runs_scored) AS lowest FROM batting_stats;
```

**Real-life**: "What's the highest score ever?"

---

### 8. GROUP BY (Group similar things)
**What**: Group rows with same values

```sql
-- Count players by country
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS player_count 
FROM players 
GROUP BY country;

-- Average runs by player
SELECT player_id, AVG(runs_scored) AS avg_runs
FROM batting_stats
GROUP BY player_id;
```

**Real-life**: "Count how many players from each country"

---

### 9. HAVING (Filter groups)
**What**: Filter after grouping (like WHERE but for groups)

```sql
-- Countries with more than 5 players
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS player_count
FROM players
GROUP BY country
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

-- Players with average > 50
SELECT player_id, AVG(runs_scored) AS avg_runs
FROM batting_stats
GROUP BY player_id
HAVING AVG(runs_scored) > 50;
```

**Real-life**: "Show countries, but only those with more than 5 players"

---

### 10. JOIN (Connect tables)
**What**: Combine data from multiple tables

```sql
-- INNER JOIN (only matching rows)
SELECT players.player_name, teams.team_name
FROM players
INNER JOIN teams ON players.team_id = teams.team_id;

-- LEFT JOIN (all from left table)
SELECT players.player_name, teams.team_name
FROM players
LEFT JOIN teams ON players.team_id = teams.team_id;
```

**Real-life**: "Show player names AND their team names by connecting two tables"

## Real Examples with Explanations

### Example 1: Simple Query
```sql
-- Find all batsmen
SELECT player_name, batting_style
FROM players
WHERE playing_role = 'Batsman';
```

**Step by step**:
1. Look at players table
2. Get player_name and batting_style columns
3. Only rows where playing_role is 'Batsman'

---

### Example 2: Aggregation
```sql
-- Count players by country
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as total_players
FROM players
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

**Step by step**:
1. Look at players table
2. Group rows by country
3. Count how many in each group
4. Sort by count, highest first

---

### Example 3: JOIN
```sql
-- Player names with team names
SELECT 
    p.player_name,
    t.team_name
FROM players p
JOIN teams t ON p.team_id = t.team_id;
```

**Step by step**:
1. Start with players table (alias 'p')
2. Connect to teams table (alias 't')
3. Match where player's team_id = team's team_id
4. Show player name and team name together

---

### Example 4: CASE Statement
```sql
-- Categorize players by age
SELECT 
    player_name,
    age,
    CASE 
        WHEN age < 25 THEN 'Young'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 25 AND 32 THEN 'Prime'
        ELSE 'Experienced'
    END AS age_category
FROM players;
```

**Step by step**:
1. Look at players table
2. For each player:
   - If age < 25, label "Young"
   - If age 25-32, label "Prime"
   - Otherwise, label "Experienced"
3. Show name, age, and category

---

### Example 5: Subquery
```sql
-- Players who scored more than average
SELECT player_name, runs_scored
FROM batting_stats bs
JOIN players p ON bs.player_id = p.player_id
WHERE runs_scored > (SELECT AVG(runs_scored) FROM batting_stats);
```

**Step by step**:
1. Inner query: Calculate average runs
2. Outer query: Find players who scored more than that average
3. Show their names and runs

---

## Common SQL Patterns

### Pattern 1: Top N
```sql
-- Top 10 scorers
SELECT player_name, total_runs
FROM player_career_stats
ORDER BY total_runs DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Pattern 2: Count by Category
```sql
-- Count by role
SELECT playing_role, COUNT(*) as count
FROM players
GROUP BY playing_role;
```

### Pattern 3: Average by Group
```sql
-- Average runs by format
SELECT match_format, AVG(total_runs) as avg_runs
FROM player_career_stats
GROUP BY match_format;
```

### Pattern 4: Filter After Grouping
```sql
-- Countries with 5+ players
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as player_count
FROM players
GROUP BY country
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5;
```

### Pattern 5: Percentage Calculation
```sql
-- Win percentage
SELECT 
    team_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_matches,
    SUM(CASE WHEN winner_id = team_id THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as wins,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN winner_id = team_id THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as win_pct
FROM matches
GROUP BY team_name;
```

## ðŸŽ“ For Your Presentation

**When asked "Explain your SQL queries":**

*"My project has 25 SQL queries in three difficulty levels:*

**Beginner queries** use basic commands:
- *SELECT to get data*
- *WHERE to filter*
- *ORDER BY to sort*
- *COUNT, SUM, AVG for calculations*
- *Simple JOINs to connect tables*

**Intermediate queries** use advanced features:
- *Multiple JOINs to connect 3-4 tables*
- *CASE statements for conditional logic*
- *Complex WHERE conditions with AND/OR*
- *HAVING to filter grouped data*

**Advanced queries** use sophisticated techniques:
- *CTEs (WITH clause) for complex logic*
- *Window functions like ROW_NUMBER and PARTITION BY*
- *Statistical measures like STDDEV for consistency*
- *Time-series analysis for trends*

*For example, Query 15 analyzes which players perform best in close matches by using multiple JOINs, OR conditions, and CASE statements to count wins."*
