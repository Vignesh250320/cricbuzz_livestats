## ðŸ”¬ Data Science Skills Showcased

### **Python Programming**
```python
# Data retrieval
def get_player_stats(player_id):
    query = "SELECT * FROM players WHERE player_id = %s"
    results = db.execute_query(query, (player_id,))
    return pd.DataFrame(results)

## ðŸŽ“ Key Data Science Queries Explained

### **Query 9: All-rounders Performance**
**Data Science Concept**: Multi-criteria filtering and statistical thresholds

```sql
SELECT 
    p.player_name,
    pcs.total_runs,
    pcs.total_wickets
FROM player_career_stats pcs
JOIN players p ON pcs.player_id = p.player_id
WHERE pcs.total_runs > 1000 
  AND pcs.total_wickets > 50
ORDER BY pcs.total_runs DESC;
```

**Analysis**: Identifies players who excel in both batting (>1000 runs) and bowling (>50 wickets)

---

### **Query 15: Close Match Performers**
**Data Science Concept**: Conditional aggregation and performance under constraints

```sql
SELECT 
    p.player_name,
    AVG(bs.runs_scored) as avg_runs,
    COUNT(DISTINCT m.match_id) as matches
FROM batting_stats bs
JOIN players p ON bs.player_id = p.player_id
JOIN matches m ON bs.match_id = m.match_id
WHERE (m.victory_type = 'runs' AND m.victory_margin < 50)
   OR (m.victory_type = 'wickets' AND m.victory_margin < 5)
GROUP BY p.player_id, p.player_name
ORDER BY AVG(bs.runs_scored) DESC;
```

**Analysis**: Statistical analysis of player performance in high-pressure situations

---

### **Query 16: Performance Trends**
**Data Science Concept**: Time-series analysis and trend identification

```sql
SELECT 
    p.player_name,
    YEAR(m.match_date) as year,
    AVG(bs.runs_scored) as avg_runs,
    AVG(bs.strike_rate) as avg_sr
FROM batting_stats bs
JOIN players p ON bs.player_id = p.player_id
JOIN matches m ON bs.match_id = m.match_id
WHERE YEAR(m.match_date) >= 2020
GROUP BY p.player_id, p.player_name, YEAR(m.match_date)
ORDER BY p.player_name, YEAR(m.match_date);
```

**Analysis**: Tracks performance changes over time to identify improving/declining trends

---

### **Query 19: Consistency Analysis**
**Data Science Concept**: Statistical measures (Standard Deviation)

```sql
SELECT 
    p.player_name,
    AVG(bs.runs_scored) as avg_runs,
    STDDEV(bs.runs_scored) as std_deviation
FROM batting_stats bs
JOIN players p ON bs.player_id = p.player_id
GROUP BY p.player_id, p.player_name
HAVING COUNT(bs.stat_id) >= 15
ORDER BY STDDEV(bs.runs_scored) ASC;
```

**Analysis**: Lower standard deviation = more consistent player

## ðŸŽ¤ Presentation Script (Data Science Focus)

### **Opening (1 minute)**
*"I've developed a Cricket Data Analytics project that demonstrates core Data Science skills. The project uses Python for programming, MySQL for data storage, SQL for data analysis, Pandas for data manipulation, and Streamlit for data visualization. It showcases the complete data science pipeline from data collection to analysis and visualization."*

### **Data Collection (1 minute)**
*"The project integrates with the Cricbuzz API to collect real-time cricket data. Using Python's requests library, I fetch JSON data, parse it, and store it in a structured MySQL database. This demonstrates the data collection phase of the data science workflow."*

### **Data Storage (1 minute)**
*"I designed a normalized database with 8 tables and proper relationships using foreign keys. This ensures data integrity and efficient querying. The database stores teams, players, matches, and performance statistics - all interconnected through relational design."*

### **Data Analysis (3 minutes)**
*"The core of this project is SQL-based data analysis with 25 queries:"*

**Show Q9**: 
*"This query uses multi-criteria filtering to find all-rounders - players with both high runs and wickets. It demonstrates JOIN operations and conditional filtering."*

**Show Q15**: 
*"This analyzes player performance in close matches using conditional aggregation. It shows who performs best under pressure - a real-world data science question."*

**Show Q16**: 
*"This is time-series analysis - tracking how player performance changes year by year. We can identify trends and patterns over time."*

### **Data Manipulation (1 minute)**
*"I use Pandas to convert SQL results into DataFrames, which allows for easy data manipulation, filtering, and transformation. The results are displayed in interactive tables."*

### **Visualization (1 minute)**
*"Streamlit provides the visualization layer, creating an interactive dashboard where users can execute queries, view results, and analyze data in real-time."*

### **Conclusion (30 seconds)**
*"This project demonstrates the complete data science workflow: data collection, storage, analysis, manipulation, and visualization - all using Python and SQL."*

## ðŸ’¬ Expected Questions (Data Science Context)

### **Q: "What data science techniques did you use?"**
**A**: *"I used SQL for statistical analysis including aggregations, JOINs, window functions, and standard deviation calculations. I used Pandas for data manipulation and Streamlit for visualization. The project also demonstrates database design, data normalization, and API integration for data collection."*

### **Q: "Explain your data analysis approach"**
**A**: *"I structured 25 SQL queries in three levels. Beginner queries use basic aggregations like COUNT and AVG. Intermediate queries use JOINs to combine multiple tables and CASE statements for conditional logic. Advanced queries use CTEs, window functions, and statistical measures like standard deviation for consistency analysis."*

### **Q: "How does Pandas fit into your project?"**
**A**: *"Pandas is used to convert SQL query results into DataFrames, which are tabular data structures. This allows for easy data manipulation, sorting, filtering, and display. It's the bridge between the database and the visualization layer."*

### **Q: "What is the difference between your beginner and advanced queries?"**
**A**: 
- **Beginner**: Simple SELECT, WHERE, basic aggregations (COUNT, SUM, AVG)
- **Intermediate**: Multiple JOINs, subqueries, CASE statements, GROUP BY with HAVING
- **Advanced**: CTEs, window functions (ROW_NUMBER, PARTITION BY), statistical analysis (STDDEV), time-series analysis

### **Q: "What data science concepts does this demonstrate?"**
**A**: *"This project demonstrates:
1. Data Collection (API integration)
2. Data Storage (database design)
3. Data Analysis (SQL queries, statistical measures)
4. Data Manipulation (Pandas DataFrames)
5. Data Visualization (Streamlit dashboards)
6. Database Management (CRUD operations)
These are fundamental skills in any data science workflow."*
